Notable examples are:

  * AVL: this is basic enough to form a good starting point
  
  * stack:  another good "learning" example

More interesting are complex harnesses for real systems:

  * pyfakefs: detected numerous faults, good example of sophisticated reference testing

  * sortedcontainers: found real bugs, another good reference testing example
  
  * sympy: detected real bugs
  
  * rsa: shows how to check some simple round-trip crypto properties, on a real library
  
  * bidict: reference testing, various exception handling methods
  
  * C: construction of strings as inputs
  
  * redis

  * simplejson
