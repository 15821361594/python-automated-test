Notable examples are:

  * AVL:  this is basic enough to form a good starting point

More interesting are complex harnesses for real systems:

  * pyfakefs: detected numerous faults, good example of sophisticated reference testing

  * sortedcontainers: found real bugs, another good reference testing example
  
  * sympy: detected real bugs
  
  * redis

  * simplejson
