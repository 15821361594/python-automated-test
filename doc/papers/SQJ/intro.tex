\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Esri ArcPy}


Esri (the Environmental Systems Research Institute) is the single
largest Geographic Information System (GIS) software vendor, with about 40\%
of global market share.  Esri's ArcGIS tools are extremely widely
used for GIS analysis, in government, scientific research, commercial
enterprises, and education.  Automation of complex GIS analysis and
data management is a frequent need, and Esri has long provided tools
for programming their GIS software tools.  The current method of
choice is a Python site-package, ArcPy \cite{ArcPy}.  ArcPy is a complex library,
with dozens of classes and hundreds of functions distributed over
a variety of of toolboxes.  Most of the code involved in ArcPy
functionality is C++ for which source is unavailable (the source for
the actual ArcGIS tools); the Python source alone is over 50,000 lines
of code.
