\section{Tool Changes}

Rather than major algorithmic innovations, the major changes to the
TSTL system required to test ArcPy were fundamentally engineering
challenges.  Only the last two changes described in this section are
concerned with novel testing algorithms and support a research
agenda.  One element that carried across all of these concerns was
fixing bugs in TSTL.  TSTL has been used in several university classes
at the graduate and undergraduate level, and used fairly extensively
in testing research, but a large number of
significant faults went undetected until we attempted to use TSTL to
test ArcPy.  One change made as a result of these problems is that we
now use TSTL to test TSTL's own API.
