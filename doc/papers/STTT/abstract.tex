A test harness, in automated test generation, defines the set of valid tests
for a system, and usually also defines a set of correctness
properties.  The difficulty of writing test harnesses is a major
obstacle to the adoption of automated test generation and model
checking.  Languages for writing test harnesses are usually tied to a
particular tool, unfamilliar to programmers, and often limit
expressiveness.  Writing test harnesses directly in the language of
the Software Under Test (SUT) is a tedious, repetitive, and
error-prone task, offers little or no support for test case
manipulation and debugging, and produces hard-to-read, hard-to-maintain
code.  Both approaches tend to tie a test harness to one method of
test generation, with little ability to explore alternative methods.
In this paper, we present TSTL, the Template Scripting Testing
Language, a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing test harnesses
that compiles harness definitions into an abstract graph-based
interface that makes generic
test generation and manipulation tools possible.  TSTL includes a
compiler to Python as well as a suite of tools for generating, manipulating,
and analyzing test cases, including simple but easily extensible explicit-state model
checkers.  This paper showcases the features of TSTL by focusing on
one large-scale testing effort, directed by an end-user, to find
faults in the most widely used Geographic Information System (GIS) tool,
Esri's ArcGIS, using its ArcPy scripting interface.  We also
demonstrate how TSTL makes prototyping and evaluating new test
generation algorithms easy for researchers.
