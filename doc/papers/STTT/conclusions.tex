\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

This paper presents the latest version of the TSTL
\cite{NFM15,ISSTA15,tstl} domain-specific language for testing, which
enables a declarative style of test harness development, where the
focus is on defining the actions in valid tests, not determining
exactly how tests are generated.  Because TSTL, inspired by the SPIN
model checker, produces a software-under-test-independent interface
for testing, TSTL makes it possible for users to easily apply
different test generation methods to the same system without undue
effort, and for researchers to rapidly prototype novel test generation
methods.  TSTL has, in the year since its initial introduction,
already been used to discover (to our knowledge) previously unknown
faults in multiple Python libraries, including the very widely-used
ArcPy site package for GIS scripting.
