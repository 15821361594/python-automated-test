\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

This paper presents the latest version of the TSTL
\cite{NFM15,ISSTA15,tstl} domain-specific language for testing, which
enables a declarative style of test harness development, where the
focus is on defining the actions in valid tests, not determining
exactly how tests are generated.
