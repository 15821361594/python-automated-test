\subsection{XML Parser}

We also examined how normalization combined with multiple faults for a
simple XML parser with about 260 lines of code \cite{myxml}, with one
original fault (a crash instead of a parse error when given an empty
tag ({\tt <>}) and one seeded fault (failure when adding two nodes
with the same name).  Running 1,000 tests produces 848 failing test
cases.  Without normalization, it takes only 37.45 seconds to execute
all 1,000 tests, including delta-debugging these 848 failures.
However, the output is 717 distinct failing test cases.  Normalizing
increases the runtime to 354.7 seconds, but reduces the number of
distinct failing tests to 5, with 3 variations of the original fault
and 2 variations of the seeded fault.  Generalizing these 5 failures
increases the runtime by less than 5 seconds.

\subsection{Esri ArcPy GIS Site-Package}

Esri (the Environmental Systems Research Institute) is the single
largest Geographic Information System software vendor, with about 40\%
of global market share.  Esri's ArcGIS tools are extremely widely
used for GIS analysis, in government, scientific research, commercial
enterprises, and education.  Automation of complex GIS analysis and
data management is a frequent need, and Esri has long provided tools
for programming their GIS software tools.  The current method of
choice is a Python site-package, ArcPy.  ArcPy is a complex library,
with dozens of classes and hundreds of functions distributed over
a variety of of toolboxes.  Most of the code involved in ArcPy
functionality is C++ for which source is unavailable (the source for
the actual ArcGIS tools); the Python source alone is over 70,000 lines
of code.

In order to improve the reliability of ArcPy, we have been
implementing a TSTL-based framework for testing ArcPy itself as well
as libraries based on ArcPy.  The TSTL definition is already more than
twice as large as the next-largest example previously studied, even
though it only includes a small portion of ArcGIS so far. The first
stage of testing has resulted in discovery of several faults in
ArcPy/ArcGIS, some of which not only cause incorrect behavior but
cause a crash that also ends testing.  Before proceeding to more
nuanced testing, it is critical to understand these faults, the set of
behaviors that trigger them, and modify the test definition to avoid
triggering these behaviors with minimal limitations on the thoroughness
of testing.

There is no space in this paper to elaborate on the details of the
process, but normalization and generalization have been very useful in
this process.  Figures \ref{esriorig} and \ref{esrinormgen} show one
crash-inducing test case, after initial delta-debugging (from over
2,000 test steps) (Figure \ref{esriorig}) and with normalization and
generalization (Figure \ref{esrinormgen}).  First, in this setting
normalization has thus contributed a surprising amount of additional
reduction over delta-debugging.  In this example, normalization
reduced the length from 19 steps to 11 steps; in another case, it
reduced the test case from 18 to 14 steps, and in the other crash
fault, it reduced the test case from 27 to 20 steps.  The cost of
normalization is high --- in our runs, it has taken from 17,340
seconds up to 24,769 seconds.  However, in this setting even
delta-debugging is extremely expensive --- the cost of reduction alone
has ranged from 7,930 seconds to 8,688 seconds.  Generalization has
taken from under an hour (3,203 seconds) up to 11,149 seconds.  These
costs are due in part to the need to run tests in a sandbox
environment to avoid killing the Python testing process, and in part
due to the cost of running complex GIS analyses.  However, even with
this high cost, reducing, normalizing, and generalizing test cases has
been a more effective use of our time than trying to understand the
faults without these aids.  For example, in the test case shown in
this paper, it was essential to understand that the SQL query and
selection type were not essential to the fault, but that using a
freshly created layer would not result in a crash:  the problem
appears to be that ArcGIS (or ArcPy) does not invalidate layers built
from a feature class when that feature class is deleted.  The
original, non-normalized test case makes this far less clear, as the
use of {\tt CopyFeatures} and the multiplicity of shapefiles involved
disguises the essence of the problem.
