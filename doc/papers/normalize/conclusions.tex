\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

This paper introduces test normalization and generalization.  The
methods presented are significant steps towards a difficult goal: providing
users of automated testing with a \emph{single test, as short and
  simple as possible, for each underlying fault in the SUT}, and
\emph{annotations describing the general conditions under which the
  fault manifests as failure}.  Normalization approaches this ideal by
rewriting numerous distinct failing tests into a smaller, often
minimal, set of simpler tests.  Generalization uses
automated experiments to distinguish essential and accidental elements of
a test.   In our experiments, normalization reduced the
number of failures to examine by well over an order of magnitude, often  to the ideal of one per fault.  The algorithms for normalization and generalization rely
on the ability of TSTL \cite{NFM15,ISSTA15} to define a total order
over test actions, based on an abstract form for tests, suitable
for term rewriting.  TSTL-based normalization is thus applicable to
any SUT, any source language, and many different test generation methods,
including those that already produce short tests
\cite{FA11,SoftBET}.  TSTL is currently available in a well-tested Python
version with full normalization and generalization implementations;
there is also a
beta version, with limited normalization, for Java.


 The goal of normalization and generalization can also be pursued in
settings other than API sequence or string grammar testing.  The
difficulties of defining a normal form for JavaScript \cite{jsfunfuzz}
or C \cite{csmith} tests are non-trivial, but not obviously
overwhelming \cite{CReduce}. Less effective methods
than ours might still aid debugging and assist fuzzer taming
\cite{PLDI13}.  Simple generalization (e.g., is this numeric constant
essential, can these two statements be swapped?) and a limited form of
fresh value generalization should be easy to apply, even for complex
programming language tests.  

TSTL is available in a working version for Python \cite{tstl} that
supports normalization and generalization.  Further experimental
evaluation of normalization and generalization over more SUTs is
important to quantify effectiveness and motivate new rewrites and
generalizations.  The TSTL implementations are designed to allow these
to be easily added, in order to bring testing closer to the
goal of ``one test to rule them all.''
