% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'

% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'

\title{Demo: TSTL: a Language and Tool for Testing}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should

Writing a test harness is a difficult and repetitive programming task,
and the lack of tool support for customized automated testing is an
obstacle to the adoption of more sophisticated testing in industry.
This paper presents TSTL, a language (and tool) allowing users to
specify the general form of valid tests for a system in a simple (but expressive)
language.  TSTL is a minimal template-based language, using the language of the
Software Under Test (SUT) to support most operations, but adding
declaratve idioms for testing.  TSTL compiles to
a common testing interface that hides that details of the
SUT, making it easy to write universal testing tools (such as
random testers or model checkers) that apply to all TSTL-defined
testing problems.  TSTL is currently available for
Python, but easily adapted to other languages as well.

\section{Introduction}

Automated testing often requires a user to write a \emph{test harness}
--- essentially a program that defines and generates the set of valid
tests for the Software Under Test (SUT).  Such harnesses are common to
random testing, many kinds of model checking, and various
machine-learning influenced approaches \cite{woda12}.  Unfortunately,
these harnesses themselves are complex software artifacts and it is
all too easy to spend valuable testing time hunting down bugs in the
test harness and not the SUT.  Harness code is often highly repetitive
(choosing between a set of available API calls to make, and assigning
values to parameters in those calls, for example) and is almost always
tightly coupled to one particular test generation method.
TSTL \cite{NFM15} is a language (and tool) intended to make these
difficulties less onerous.

First, TSTL allows a harness to be defined in a declarative style,
and provides support for many common testing idioms.  Second, the
declarative approach allows TSTL to output a generalized interface for
testing:  a class that allows a testing tool to determine available
test actions, check for success or failure of tests as they progress,
and even automatically produce logging, collect and analyze code
coverage, and delta-debug failed tests.
